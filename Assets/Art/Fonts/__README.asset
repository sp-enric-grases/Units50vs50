    text: 'As an artist, you need to import your art assets inside Unity to start
      working. However, many times it is not yet decided where the assets will end
      up, and which assets will be discarded.


      On top of that, other people may need to have access to those temporary assets
      to keep working. That is why this folder has to be under version control (Git).


      The _WIP folder is a necessary evil. You must <color=red>handle this with care</color>.
      Of course, as the name of the folder implies, this folder should be completely
      empty in a release branch.'
